This project grew out of a collaboration on the kiddraw project (https://github.com/brialorelle/kiddraw). A core question underlying that project is: What developmental changes explain age-related variation in children’s ability to produce and comprehend graphical representations (e.g., drawings of  object categories)?

### Question
Here we ask: How does the ability to decompose complex visual shapes into parts and recompose these parts into composite shapes develop throughout childhood?

### Approach
To investigate this phenomenon, we plan to take the following strategy:

1. Measure age-related variation in the ability to copy composite shapes by drawing. 
Prediction: younger children will have more difficulty in producing high-fidelity reconstructions of these composite shapes.
2. Measure age-related variation in the ability to copy simple shapes by drawing. 
Prediction: performance will be relatively high and more similar across age groups than in the composite shapes condition.
3. Test whether a “curriculum” that provides experience with simple shapes and some simple combinations of simple shapes facilitates transfer to a task requiring the reconstruction of a composite shape.

This could be accomplished by training in the “bottom-up” strategy of starting with practice reproducing simple shapes and simple combinations of them, and/or by the “top-down” strategy of directing children to the compositional structure by explicitly segmenting the composite shape into simpler parts (e.g., by color coding).
